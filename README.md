The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how different data processing pipelines work, i.e. Batch Ingestions, Event Ingestion and Stream Ingestion.
The tool was done for personal fun as an attempt at TUI and to demo the scenarios for an audience.

The tool works in a terminal, where upon selection of a scenario, a data processing demonstarion is shown.
The demonstration is in the form of the timeline, where The working hours are assumed to be 8:00-17:00 and on the timeline there is a demonstratoin of when processing is not happening, when is happening or when is it failing.
Furthermore the timeline also shows the state of the system:
1) Whether it's working hours
2) Whether some processing is being done
3) If the data is stale or up to date.
